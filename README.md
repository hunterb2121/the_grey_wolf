# the_grey_wolf

This is a webpage about Grey Wolves with interesting information about the different subspecies and the behaviors common amongst them.

A page for me to learn the LESS preprocessor for CSS, using information from Wikipedia about the Grey Wolf.
This page was created as a final project for my Intermediate CSS and Preprocessors class.
Unused mixins in the LESS files were examples from previous classes to learn how to make them.
