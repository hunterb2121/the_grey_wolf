            <h2>Social Structure</h2>
            <p>A wolf is a social animal. There are two types of wolves, pack wolves and lone wolves. Lone wolves are typically only lone temporarily to go to a new pack or form their own. The average pack size in North America is eight and the average in Europe is five and a half. The average pack across all Eurasia is 8 and can consist of two or three families instead of the typical one family per pack. Offspring stay with the pack anywhere from 10-54 months before moving on. This can be caused by sexual maturity or competition for resources. A new pack is formed when a lone female and male find each other and move to a place with less competition. Wolf packs also won't typically adopt new wolves into the pack, typically killing the new wolf. If one is adopted into the pack, it is usually when they are juveniles who won't be able to really compete with the breeding pair. These adoptees can mate with a female and split off to form a new pack. Wolves are also very territorial, making large territories with more resources than they need.</p>

                <li><h4>Fun Fact</h4></li>
                <li>The largest pack territory was held by 10 wolves in Alaska. The territory was 2,422 sq mi.</li>
                <li>The smallest pack territory was held by 6 wolves in Montana. The territory was 13 sq mi.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>Wolves are monogamous. They mate and pair together for life, forming their own packs and families together. If one dies, the deceased pair is replaced with a new wolf. Wolves mature at two and sexually mature at three. Females can produce one liter a year on average. Dens are constructed for pups during the summer to keep the newborns and young pups safe. The gestation period for a wolf is 62-75 days or around two months. The mortality rate of the pups is very high at 60%-80%.</p>

            <h2>Hunting</h2>
            <p>Wolves are pack hunters. This means that they gang up together to hunt their prey. Single or couples are better at taking down large prey rather than large packs. Wolves will typically use the same trials across their terriroy to track prey. The have similar vision to humans and far better smell in order to track their prey. Wolves will try to isolate the weakest member of a pack of herbivores. They try to tire it out before going in for the kill. If an animal stands it's ground against a wolf, the wolf will typically back down and ignore it or try to intimidate the prey into running. The wolves will then focus on slowing down and disabling the prey by attacking the legs, back, and side while persuing. After they take down the prey, the breeding pair will typically eat their fare first for doing the most work before the rest of the pack will eat. The rest of the pack will take their pieces to secluded areas to eat to avoid fighting. The wolves will eat organs and muscles. Wolves can eat 15-19% of it's bodyweight in one meal.</p>
